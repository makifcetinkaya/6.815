Length: 8-9 hours

Potential Issues: I tested the functions only with the given images.
I have to admit that the morphing did not work nearly as good as I
thought it would. But I think that is mainly because I didn't used only
linear interpolations. Other than morphing, there might be problems
with pixel-by-pixel testing of my functions(due to, for instance, i
ndex starting with 0 vs 1 ). It didn't make sense to me to test 
warping&morphing pixel-by-pixel, I just judged my code by how good the
transformation(s) looks overall.

Extra Credit: None

Collaboration: None

Most difficult: I think overall the pset was well-written, so I didn't
get stuck. But especially in calculating the segments transforms I had
to leave my desk for a couple of times to relax and come back to debug 
my code.

Most exciting: It was really nice to implement morphing as it is
professionally-used application of digital photography. Also 
running a program and waiting for its results for an hour was pretty 
cool.
