LENGTH: 7 hours

Potential Issues: I could not efficiently test makeHDR. I just tested it
with a couple k values and saved the image of hdr*k. But I could not tell
it worked. And my makeHDR code has bug :/

Most Difficult:Tone Mapping was  difficult. It took me a while to figure 
out how to pass the parameters to filters. Also, scaling was confusing,
but I got help from piazza where Fredo explained it. (Discussion #89) 

Most Exciting: Creating an HDR image was pretty exciting.
