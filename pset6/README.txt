LENGTH: 7 hours

Potential Issues: I could not test the stitch function intensively. The
translation did not work properly. There might be problem with zipping
order of points.

Most Difficult: Putting everything together. Combining the translation and
homography matrices were challenging. 

Most Exciting: Combining the stata images was fun!
