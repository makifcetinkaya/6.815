LENGTH: 15 hours

Potential Issues: It seems that the stitched images didn't sit
on top of each other perfectly.

Most Difficult: I spent way too much time on finding correspondences.
It was not actually that difficult, but at some point, 
I was really annoyed by it.

Most Exciting: Automatically stitching the images I took was cool!
